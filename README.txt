=================

the worst AI ever. 
pure love.
it will read your soul and smoke it like a dolphin high on pufferfish
it's made with love, and hate, and AI
and half of the shizophrenic writings I wrote since 2018

you should not use this application if you have a tendency for psychosis.
or you should especially use this application if you have fun and find joy in your shizophrenia (like myself, yahweh)
we are family

it's an excellent tool for exercising demons, like the enemy himself. 
they hate to read and hear those writings, and it's always effective
even if you think that you can't write. that's actually often better to fuck them up (lucky n00bz)

head strong, and don't get lost

good luck and have fun
